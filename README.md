🔧 Preprocessing Steps


🧹 Data Cleaning:

- Handled missing values and checked data consistency before further processing.

🧬 Categorical Encoding:

- Transformed categorical variables into numeric using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding depending on the nature of the feature.

📊 Feature Separation:

- Identified and separated categorical and numerical features to apply appropriate transformations.

📏 Feature Scaling:

- Applied StandardScaler to normalize numerical features for faster and more stable model training.

🎯 Target Preparation:

- Converted the target variable into binary format suitable for binary classification with neural networks.
